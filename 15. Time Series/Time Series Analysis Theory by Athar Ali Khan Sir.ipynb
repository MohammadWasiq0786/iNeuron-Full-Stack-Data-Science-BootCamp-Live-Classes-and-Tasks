    "\n",
    "Data obtained from observations collected sequentially over time are extremely common.In business, we observe weekly interest rates, daily closing stock prices, monthly price indices, yearly sales figures, and so forth. In meteorology, we observe daily high and low temperatures, annual precipitation and drought indices, and hourly wind speeds. In agriculture, we record annual figures for crop and livestock production, soil erosion, and export sales. In the biological sciences, we observe the electrical activity of the heart at millisecond intervals. In ecology, we record the abundance of an animal species.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of time series analysis is generally twofold: to understand or model the stochastic mechanism that gives rise to an observed series and to predict or forecast the future values of a series based on the history of that series and, possibly, other related series or factors.\n",

    "## Examples of Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "### Annual Rainfall in Los Angeles\n",
    "Exhibit 1.1 displays a time series plot of the annual rainfall amounts recorded in Los Angeles, California, over more than 100 years. The plot shows considerable variation in rainfall amount over the years—some years are low, some high, and many are in-between in value. The year 1883 was an exceptionally wet year for Los Angeles, While 1983 was quite dry. For analysis and modeling purposes we are interested in whether or not consecutive years are related in some way. If so, we might be able to use one year’s rainfall value to help forecast next year’s rainfall amount. One graphical way to investigate that question is to pair up consecutive rainfall values and plot the resulting scatterplot of pairs.\n",

    "Above figure shows scatterplot for rainfall. For example, the point plotted near the lower right-hand corner shows that the year of extremely high rainfall, 40 inches in 1883, was followed by a middle of the road amount (about 12 inches) in 1884. The point near the top of the display shows that the 40 inch year was preceded by a much more typical year of about 15 inches.\n",

From a modeling or forecasting point of view, this is not a very interesting time series.\n",

    "As a second example, we consider a time series from an industrial chemical process. The variable measured here is a color property from consecutive batches in the process.

The trend is apparent but is not terribly strong. For example, the correlation in this scatterplot is about 0.6.\n",

    "The average monthly temperatures (in degrees Fahrenheit) over a number of years recorded in Dubuque, Iowa, are shown in Exhibit 1.7. This time series displays a very regular pattern called seasonality. Seasonality for monthly values occurs when observations twelve months apart are related in some manner or another. All Januarys and Februarys are quite cold but they are similar in value and different from the temperatures of the warmer months of June, July, and August, for example. There is still variation among the January values and variation among the June values. Models for such series must accommodate this variation while preserving the similarities.

    "Our last example for this chapter concerns the monthly sales to dealers of a specialty oil filter for construction equipment manufactured by John Deere. When these data were first presented to one of the authors, the manager said, “There is no reason to believe that these sales are seasonal.” Seasonality would be present if January values tended to be related to other January values, February values tended to be related to other February values, and so forth. The time series plot shown in Exhibit 1.8 is not designed to display seasonality especially well. Exhibit 1.9 gives the same plot but amended to use meaningful plotting symbols. In this plot, all January values are plotted with the character J, all Februarys with F, all Marches with M, and so forth.† With these plotting symbols, it is much easier to see that sales for the winter months of January and February all tend to be high, while sales in September, October, November, and December are gener-ally quite low. The seasonality in the data is much easier to see from this modified time series plot.\n",

    "The sequence of random variables ${Y_t : t = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3,\\cdots}$ is called a stochastic process and serves as a model for an observed time series.

Much of the information in these joint distributions can be described in terms of means, variances, and covariances. Consequently, we concentrate our efforts on these first and second moments.

    "## Stationarity\n",
    "The basic idea of stationarity is that the probability laws that govern the behavior of the process do not change over time. In a sense, the process is in statistical equilibrium. Specifically, a process $\\{Y_t\\}$ is said to be **strictly stationary** if the joint distribution of $Y_{t_1}, Y_{t_2},...,Y_{t_n}$ is the same as the joint distribution of $Y_{t_1-k}, Y_{t_2-k},...,Y_{t_n-k}$ for all choices of time points $t_1,t_2,...,t_n$ and all choices of time lag $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, when $n=1$ the (univariate) distribution of $Y_t$ is the same as that of $Y_{t − k}$ for all $t$ and $k;$ in other words, the $Y's$ are (marginally) identically distributed. It then follows that $E(Y_t)=E(Y_{t−k})$ for all $t$ and $k$ so that the mean function is constant for all time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, $Var(Y_t)=Var(Y_{t−k})$ for all $t$ and $k$ so that the variance is also constant over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting $n=2$ in the stationarity definition we see that the bivariate distribution of $Y_t$ and $Y_s$ must be the same as that of $Y_{t−k}$ and $Y_{s−k}$ from which it follows that $Cov(Y_t, Y_s)= Cov(Y_{t−k}, Y_{s−k})$ for all $t$, $s$, and $k$. Putting $k=s$ and then $k=t$, we obtain\n",

    "That is, the covariance between $Y_t$ and $Y_s$ depends on time only through the time difference $|t−s|$ and not otherwise on the actual times $t$ and $s$. Thus, for a stationary process, we can simplify our notation and write\n",

For example, the fact that the March and April means are quite similar (and different from the June and July means) is not reflected in the model. In some cases, seasonal trends can be modeled economically with cosine curves that incorporate the smooth change expected from one time period to the next while still preserving the seasonality.\n",

Since the curve repeats itself exactly every $1/f$ time units, $1/f$ is called the period of the cosine wave. $\\Phi$ serves to set the arbitrary origin on the time axis. For monthly data with time indexed as $1,2,...,$ the most important frequency is $f=1/12$, because such a cosine wave will repeat itself every $12$ months. We say that the period is $12$.\n",

Tentatively assuming stationarity, we would like to estimate the autocorrelation function $\\rho_k$ for a variety of lags $k=1,2,...$. The obvious way to do this is to compute the sample correlation between the pairs $k$ units apart in time. That is, among $(Y_1,Y_{1+k}), (Y_2,Y_{2+k}), (Y_3,Y_{3+k}),...,$ and $(Y_{n−k},Y_n)$.

    "# TIME SERIES MODELS OF HETEROSCEDASTICITY\n",
    "The models discussed so far concern the conditional mean structure of time series data. However, more recently, there has been much work on modeling the conditional variance structure of time series data---mainly motivated by the needs for financial modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    " Let ${Y_t}$ be a time series of interest. The conditional variance of $Y_t$ given the past $Y$ values, $Y_{t − 1},Y_{t − 2}, \\dots$, measures the uncertainty in the deviation of $Y_t$  from its conditional mean $E(Y_t|Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, \\cdots)$. If $Y_t$, follows some ARIMA model, the (one-step ahead) conditional variance is always equal to the noise variance for any present and past values of the process. Indeed, the constancy of the conditional variance is true for predictions of any fixed number of steps ahead for an ARIMA process. In practice, the (one-step-ahead) conditional variance may vary with the current and past values of the process, and, as such, the conditional variance is itself a random process, often referred to as the conditional variance process. For example, daily returns of stocks are often observed to have larger conditional variance following a period of violent price movement than a relatively stable period. The development of models for the conditional variance process with which we can predict the variability of future values based on current and past data is the main concern of the present chapter.\n",

    "## Some Common Features of Financial Time Series\n",
    "As an example of financial time series, we consider the daily values of a unit of the CREF stock fund over the period from August 26, 2004 to August 15, 2006. The CREF stock fund is a fund of several thousand stocks and is not openly traded in the stock market.  Since stocks are not traded over weekends or on holidays, only on so-called trading days, the CREF data do not change over weekends and holidays. For simplicity, we will analyze the data as if they were equally spaced. Exhibit 12.1 shows the time series plot of the CREF data. It shows a generally increasing trend with a hint of higher variability with higher level of the stock value. Let ${p_t}$ be the time series of, say, the daily price of some financial asset. The (continuously compounded) return on the $t^{th}$ day is defined as\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes the returns are then multiplied by 100 so that they can be interpreted as percentage changes in the price. The multiplication may also reduce numerical errors as the raw returns could be very small numbers and render large rounding errors in some calculations.\n",

    "Form above plot it is clear that returns were more volatile over some time periods and became very volatile toward the end of the study period. The average CREF return equals 0.0493 with a standard error of 0.02885.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the volatility clustering observed in the CREF return data gives us a hint that they may not be independently and identically distributed—otherwise the variance would be constant over time. This is the first occasion in our study of time series models where we need to distinguish between series values being uncorrelated and series values being independent. If series values are truly independent, then nonlinear instantaneous transformations such as taking logarithms, absolute values, or squaring preserves independence. However, the same is not true of correlation, as correlation is only a measure of linear dependence. Higher-order serial dependence structure in data can be explored by studying the autocorrelation structure of the absolute returns (of lesser sampling variability with less mathematical tractability) or that of the squared returns (of greater sampling variability but with more manageability in terms of statistical theory). If the returns are independently and identically distributed, then so are the absolute returns (as are the squared returns), and hence they will be white noise as well. Hence, if the absolute or squared returns admit some significant autocorrelations, then these autocorrelations furnish some evidence against the hypothesis that the returns are independently and identically distributed. Indeed, the sample ACF and PACF of the absolute returns and those of the squared returns in Exhibits 12.5 through 12.8 display some significant autocorrelations and hence provide some evidence that the daily CREF returns are not independently and identically distributed.\n",
